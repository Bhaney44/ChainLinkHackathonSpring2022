# Smart Contracts

A smart contract is a new type of technology at the confluence of contracts and blockchains. The term smart contract is defined in wide variance among blockchain developers and professionals. For example, the Founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin defines smart contract as, “systems which automatically move digital assets according to arbitrary pre-specified rules.”[1](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/) Another example, the former MIT professor and current Commissioner of the SEC Gary Gensler, adopts Nick Szabo’s definition of smart contract, “A set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises.”[2](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/resources/session-6-smart-contracts-and-dapps/) 

# Chainlink Contracts

This repository includes Chainlink smart contracts used in the development of the Chainlink Converter.
The main smart contract for the converter validates data from Algorand on Ethereum and is processed using a Chainlink node.
The node validates the data generating a Decentralized Oralcle Network link Algorand and Ethereum through Chainlink.
